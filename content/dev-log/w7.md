# Updating to nixos 23.05

The new nixos version is out and I spent some time on updating my system to the latest version. Over all it went pretty well, but of course my neovim config kind of broke. I had to patch up several issues with some of the plugins. Even after that I think something is still slightly off. The syntax highlithing is different in both good and bad ways. It's a bit irritating that it changed because I got used to it, but on the other hand there are a few new things that are highlighted in a better way than before.

Other than that I was finally able to fix up some smaller things that were "broken". My `tmux` battery display is finally working again. I also removed some of the things I wasn't using before like the `neorg` plugin for neovim which was probably eating quite a bit of the performance.

I was a bit busy with private things and work over the last week/weekend so I didn't have much time to do anything besides the above mentioned update. I saw that there is a new issue on `codeberg-cli` which I'm very happy about. I hope I'll find the time to resolve it in the near future.
