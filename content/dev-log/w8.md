# Additional Updates to NixOS

This week I finally completed my NixOS styling config by applying a fitting theme to my `starship` prompt. Of course I used my beloved [catppuccin theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin). Now all my color themes finally start fitting together.

# Experiments with `leptos` + `axum`

Since I had some spare time and I'm currently lacking something new to learn I started investigating the web-app world of Rust a bit further. For this I took a rough look at `axum` web framework and the `leptos` framework for building web apps. It took me some time to figure out how to build and run the example apps but it looks promising. I like the way leptos handles reactivity and I might try it out this year a bit further. `axum` also seems pretty interesting on its own and I might try to write a little service with it to host it on my server.

# Website of Steffenhagen with `zola`

I really like a local restaurant in my neighbourhood called Steffenhagen. Shoutout to them! Their web appearance seemed a bit out of date and I felt creative this week so I just sat down for one afternoon and glued some extra content and CSS to an existing `zola` theme to create this beauty here. I mailed them and offered them the website for free. Let's see if they reply ðŸ™ˆ

# Shadertoy

While browsing the web, I found a neat little video showcasing some shader stuff on the shadertoy website. I really loved the visuals and also shader coding in general. So I took some time to give the example from the video my own spin (literally lol). Here's the result.

And here is the code. (Warning, might be flashy!)

```glsl
const float rep_val = 17.0;
const float num_iter = 4.0;
const float asymetric_uv = 1.6;
const float flash_time = 0.7;
const float rotate_time = 0.1;
const float dist_time = 0.07;
const float zoom_time = 0.1;


vec3 palette(float t) {
    float st = sin(t) * 2.0 - 1.0;
    float ct = cos(t) * 2.0 - 1.0;
    vec3 a = vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
    vec3 b = vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
    vec3 c = vec3(.75, .75, .75);
    vec3 d = vec3(0.7, 0.6, 0.5);
    return a + b * cos(2.0 * 3.1415 * (c*t+d));
}

vec2 rotate(vec2 v, float a) {
	float s = sin(a);
	float c = cos(a);
	mat2 m = mat2(c, -s, s, c);
	return m * v;
}


vec3 iter_once(vec2 uv, vec2 uvo, float i) {
    float dist_mid_o = length(uvo);
    float dist_mid = length(uv) * exp(-dist_mid_o);
    vec3 color = palette(iTime * i * flash_time + dist_mid_o);
    dist_mid = dist_mid + iTime * dist_time;
    dist_mid = sin(dist_mid * rep_val) / rep_val;
    dist_mid = abs(dist_mid);
    float damp_val = pow(num_iter, 4.0) * 100.0;
    dist_mid = exp(-(dist_mid * dist_mid) * damp_val);
    return color * vec3(dist_mid);
}

void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
{
    vec2 uvo = (fragCoord * 2.0 - iResolution.xy) / iResolution.y;
    uvo = rotate(uvo / abs(sin(iTime * zoom_time) * 0.5 + 1.0), iTime * rotate_time);
    vec2 uv = uvo;
    vec2 uv2 = uvo * 0.1;
    vec3 final_color = vec3(0.0);


    for(float i = 0.0; i < num_iter; i++) {
        uv = fract(uv* asymetric_uv) - 0.5;
        uv2 = fract(uv2 * asymetric_uv) - 0.5;
        final_color += iter_once(uv, uvo, i) + iter_once(uv2, uvo * 0.5, i);
    }
    // Output to screen
    fragColor = vec4(final_color, 1.0);
}
```

# Exercism Haskell (argh)

Yesterday I was finally in the mood for some more Haskell again. So I started to solve some more exercises on Exercism. The problems were not interesting enough to mention them here and in the end I solved two, but boy this was a ride. The problems themselves weren't the problem but rather compiling Haskell code on NixOS. I tried out several approaches:

- stack2nix (didn't work, it's broken)
- cabal2nix (didn't work, ghc version issue)
- cabal2nix 2nd try (didn't work, ghc version ok now to compile but LSP didn't like the ghc version)
- cabal2nix 3rd try (didn't work with any ghc version I tried out from `nixpkgs`. Either LSP or compilation via `cabal` failed)
- just try out vanilla `cabal build` -> works (?!)

As you can guess, I was pretty tired and confused after all of this. The solution was basically to do a `cabal init` on an already existing project which was made to work with `stack` (which doesn't work for me at all). After that some files need to be renamed and moved and then it finally works ðŸŽ‰

I'll probably do some more Haskell problem solving in the coming weeks since I feel very refreshed after those small Haskell sessions.
